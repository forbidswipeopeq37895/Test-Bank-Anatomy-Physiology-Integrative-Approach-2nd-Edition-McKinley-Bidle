  * An Integrative Approach, 2e brings multiple elements of the study of A&P together in ways that maximize understanding. Text discussions provide structural details in the context of their functional significance to integrate coverage of anatomy and physiology in each chapter. Chapters emphasize the interdependence of body systems by weaving prior coverage of one system into textual explanations of how other systems work. These system relationships are also covered in “Integrate: Concept Connection” boxes. All figures are carefully designed to support the text narrative, and carry brief textual explanations to make figures self-contained study tools. Special “Concept Overview” figures in each chapter tie together multi-faceted concepts in 1- or 2-page visual summaries. Applications are presented in “Integrate: Clinical View” boxes to apply chapter content using clinical examples that show students what can go wrong in the body, to help crystallize understanding of the “norm.” Critical Thinking questions in “What Do You Think?” engage students in application or analysis to encourage students to think more globally about the content; ‘What Did You Learn’ are mini self-tests at the end of each section that assess whether students have a sufficient grasp of the content before moving on. End-of-chapter “Challenge Yourself” assessments include ‘Do You Know the Basics”, “Can You Apply What You've Learned?”, and “Can You Synthesize What You've Learned?” question sets. Career opportunities pursued by students studying A&P are highlighted at the beginning of each chapter. Everyday analogies and practical advice for remembering material are presented in “Integrate: Learning Strategy” boxes.
